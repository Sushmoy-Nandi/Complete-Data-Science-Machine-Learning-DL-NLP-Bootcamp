    "# Support Vector Regression (SVR)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** adapts the concepts of Support Vector Machines for predicting **continuous values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The algorithm constructs a **best fit line** along with two **marginal planes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **$\\epsilon$ (Epsilon)** represents the **margin error**, denoting the distance between the best fit line and the marginal planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **$\\eta_i$ or $\\xi_i$ (Eta/Xi)** represents the **error above the margin** for data points that fall completely outside the marginal planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **$C$** is an important **hyperparameter**; as its value increases, the **loss function** decreases.\n",

    "## Understanding Support Vector Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a classification problem, a regression problem predicts a **continuous value**, such as predicting the price of a house based solely on its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, SVR utilizes a **best fit line** that is mathematically defined by the equation $w^T x + b$. From this central boundary, the algorithm establishes two parallel boundaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The top marginal plane is represented by $w^T x + b + \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The bottom marginal plane is represented by $w^T x + b - \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Margin Error and Deviations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Epsilon ($\\epsilon$)**: This parameter acts as the **margin error**. The model performs optimally when the absolute difference between the true target point and the predicted point is less than or equal to $\\epsilon$. When this condition is met, it indicates that the data point falls securely within the designated marginal planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Eta/Xi ($\\eta_i$ / $\\xi_i$)**: In practical applications, some points will inevitably fall outside the strict marginal boundaries. To account for this, the model calculates the specific deviation of these external points from the marginal planes. The summation of all these external deviations is then factored into the model as a hyperparameter, allowing it to construct a more generalized and robust boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## SVR Cost Function and Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary mathematical objective of SVR is to minimize the overall cost function. Incorporating the deviations, the function is defined as:\n",
    "$Min_{w,b} \\frac{||w||}{2} + C \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\xi_i$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This optimization relies on continuously adjusting the weights ($w$) and bias ($b$), heavily guided by the hyperparameter **$C$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship between $C$ and Loss**: There is a strict, inverse relationship between the **$C$** hyperparameter and the resulting loss. As you progressively increase the value of $C$, the **loss function** will smoothly decrease."
