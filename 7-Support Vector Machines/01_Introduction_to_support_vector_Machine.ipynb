    "# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Geometric Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a machine learning algorithm used to solve both classification and regression problems.\n",
    "* When applied to classification, it is called a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**.\n",
    "* When applied to regression, it is known as **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**.\n",
    "* A solid understanding of **logistic regression** is highly recommended before diving into SVMs.\n",
    "* SVM aims to separate data categories by creating a **best fit line** in 2D, a **3D plane** in 3D, or a **hyperplane** in n-dimensions.\n",
    "* The algorithm introduces **marginal planes** that run parallel to the main decision boundary.\n",
    "* The core objective is to select the boundary and marginal planes that yield the **maximum distance** between the marginal planes.\n",
    "* The data points closest to the boundary, which the marginal planes intersect, are defined as **support vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Support Vector Machines\n",
    "The **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a versatile machine learning algorithm designed to handle two primary types of predictive modeling:\n",
    "* **Classification**: In these scenarios, the algorithm is referred to as a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**.\n",
    "* **Regression**: When predicting continuous numerical values, it is known as **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully understand how an SVM operates, it is heavily advised to first comprehend the mathematical intuition behind **logistic regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geometric Intuition and Decision Boundaries\n",
    "Much like logistic regression, an SVM seeks to cleanly separate different categories of data points in binary or multi-class classification tasks. It accomplishes this by constructing a decision boundary that clearly divides the distinct classes. The geometric representation of this boundary depends on the number of features (dimensions) within the dataset:\n",
    "* In a 2D feature space, the decision boundary is a **straight best fit line**.\n",
    "* In a 3D feature space, the boundary becomes a **3D plane**.\n",
    "* In an n-dimensional feature space, the boundary is mathematically generalized as a **hyperplane**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this boundary is established, new incoming test data is categorized based simply on which side of the plane or line the data point falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marginal Planes and Maximizing Distance\n",
    "The defining characteristic that sets SVM apart from standard logistic regression is the utilization of additional boundaries known as **marginal planes**. \n",
    "* Alongside the primary best fit line or hyperplane, the algorithm constructs two marginal planes directly parallel to it.\n",
    "* These two marginal planes must be positioned equidistant from the central best fit line.\n",
    "* The primary objective of an SVM is to identify the specific best fit line and marginal plane combination where the total distance (often denoted as $d$) between the two marginal planes is at its **maximum**.\n",
    "* For example, if the model evaluates two potential boundaries with marginal plane distances of $d$ and $d^1$, it will actively select the configuration with the larger gap (e.g., maximizing the margin so that $d > d^1$) to perform the final classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support Vectors\n",
    "To maximize this separation, the marginal planes are positioned so that they pass directly through the data points situated nearest to the central best fit line.\n",
    "* These specific, nearest data points are formally called **support vectors**.\n",
    "* By utilizing these support vectors to construct the marginal planes, the SVM ensures a clear, highly confident classification boundary for categorizing the dataset."
