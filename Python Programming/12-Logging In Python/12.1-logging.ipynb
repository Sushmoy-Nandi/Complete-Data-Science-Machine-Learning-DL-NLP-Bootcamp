        "\n",
        "Logging is a crucial aspect of application development, providing a mechanism to track events, errors, and operational information. It is essential for debugging end-to-end projects and understanding application behavior, offering a more robust solution than simple print statements.\n",

        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging allows developers to capture detailed information about a program's execution. It serves as a flexible framework for emitting messages that help in diagnosing issues, especially in complex or production environments where direct console access might be limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Log Levels\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's logging module defines standard levels indicating the severity of events. By default, the logging system handles warnings and higher.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **DEBUG**: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
        "* **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
        "* **WARNING**: An indication that something unexpected happened, or a problem might occur in the near future (e.g., 'disk space low'). The software is still working as expected.\n",
        "* **ERROR**: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n",
        "* **CRITICAL**: A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "The `basicConfig` function is used to configure the logging system.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Note**: `basicConfig` needs to be called *before* any logging calls occur. In environments like Jupyter Notebooks, if you wish to change the configuration (e.g., change the file or format), you often need to restart the kernel because `basicConfig` is intended to be run only once per session.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.1 Basic Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "To start logging, you import the module and set the threshold level."
