    "# Logistic Regression: Binary Classification Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logistic Regression** is an algorithm primarily used to solve **binary classification problems**.\n",
    "* Using **Linear Regression** for classification creates structural issues because it relies on an extending **best fit line**.\n",
    "* **Outliers** can dramatically distort the best fit line in Linear Regression, causing incorrect predictions.\n",
    "* Linear Regression can produce unbounded predictions that fall **greater than 1** or **less than 0**.\n",
    "* Logistic Regression resolves this boundary issue by **squashing** the output to strictly fall between **0 and 1**.\n",

    "## Understanding Binary Classification Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "A **binary classification problem** involves predicting an output that belongs to exactly two categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: Using **study hours** to predict whether a student will **pass or fail** an exam.\n",
    "* The **Pass** category is labeled as `1`.\n",
    "* The **Fail** category is labeled as `0`.\n",
    "* The model takes study hours as input and predicts the probability of passing.\n",

    "## Problems with Linear Regression for Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying **Linear Regression** to classification introduces two major problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Negative Impact of Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose we draw a best fit line for study hours.\n",
    "* We might set a threshold:\n",
    "  * Predict `0` if output ≤ 0.5\n",
    "  * Predict `1` if output > 0.5\n",
    "* If a large **outlier** (e.g., 12 study hours) is introduced, the best fit line shifts.\n",
    "* This shift can cause previously correct predictions (e.g., a 5-hour pass) to fall below the threshold and become misclassified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Unbounded Output Values\n",
    "\n",
    "* A linear best fit line extends infinitely.\n",
    "* Predictions can be:\n",
    "  * Greater than 1\n",
    "  * Less than 0\n",
    "* In classification, outputs represent probabilities and must lie strictly between **0 and 1**."
