    "# Elastic Net Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Elastic Net Regression** is a hybrid algorithm that combines the properties of both **Ridge Regression (L2)** and **Lasso Regression (L1)**.\n",
    "* It serves a dual purpose: it helps to **reduce overfitting** while simultaneously performing **feature selection**.\n",
    "* The algorithm modifies the cost function by adding **two penalty terms**: one based on the square of the slope (Ridge) and one based on the magnitude of the slope (Lasso).\n",
    "* It is particularly useful when dealing with complex models that have a large number of features and are suffering from overfitting.\n",

    "### When to use Elastic Net?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** When should you use Elastic Net Regression instead of just Ridge or Lasso?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "You should use **Elastic Net** when your model is **overfitting** and also contains a **large number of features**.  \n",
    "While Ridge handles overfitting and Lasso handles feature selection, Elastic Net allows you to solve both problems at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition of Elastic Net\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What is Elastic Net composed of?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "Elastic Net is a combination of **Ridge Regression** and **Lasso Regression**.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Elastic Net Regression Details\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elastic Net Regression** is a regularization technique designed to leverage the strengths of both Ridge and Lasso regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cost Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net, the cost function is the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) plus **two distinct penalty terms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(\\theta) =\n",
    "\\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2\n",
    "+\n",
    "\\lambda_1 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ (slope)^2\n",
    "+\n",
    "\\lambda_2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\\ slope|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **First Term**: Standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) from Linear Regression.\n",
    "* **Second Term ($\\lambda_1 \\sum \\ (slope)^2$)**: **Ridge (L2) penalty**, used to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "* **Third Term ($\\lambda_2 \\sum |\\ slope|$)**: **Lasso (L1) penalty**, used for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Elastic Net?\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net is useful in scenarios where multiple problems occur simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overfitting**  \n",
    "   * The model fits training data very well but performs poorly on test data.\n",
    "   * The Ridge component ($\\lambda_1$) helps reduce variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High Dimensionality**  \n",
    "   * The dataset contains a very large number of features.\n",
    "   * The Lasso component ($\\lambda_2$) shrinks coefficients of unimportant features to **zero**, performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Elastic Net, you effectively **tune the bias–variance tradeoff** while simultaneously controlling model complexity and feature importance.\n"
