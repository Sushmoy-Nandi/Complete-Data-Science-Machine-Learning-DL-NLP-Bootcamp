    "# Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Polynomial Regression** is a machine learning algorithm used to model **non-linear relationships** between dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "* While **Simple Linear Regression** fits a straight line to data, Polynomial Regression fits a **curve** to minimize error in non-linear datasets.\n",
    "* The shape of the model is determined by the **polynomial degree**; a higher degree increases the complexity of the curve.\n",
    "* A **degree of 0** results in a constant value, while a **degree of 1** equates to simple linear regression.\n",
    "* Increasing the degree allows the model to fit data points more closely, but a degree that is too high (e.g., 15) leads to **overfitting**, where the model captures noise rather than the general trend.\n",
    "* The goal is to select a degree that **generalizes** the model well, avoiding both underfitting and overfitting.\n",
    "* The algorithm can handle **multiple independent features** by expanding the equation to include the powers of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Regression Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear vs. Non-Linear Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Simple Linear Regression**, the primary aim is to create a **best fit line** for a single independent feature ($x$) and a single dependent feature ($y$).  \n",
    "If there are multiple input features, the goal shifts to creating a **plane** (for 3D data) or a **hyperplane** (for higher dimensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, linear models fail when the dataset exhibits a **non-linear relationship**, such as a curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Applying a straight **best fit line** to curved data results in a high **loss value**.\n",
    "* To effectively minimize error and capture such relationships, a linear model is insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Role of Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polynomial Regression** is used to identify and model these **non-linear relationships**.  \n",
    "Ideally, the model produces a curve that captures the data pattern with significantly lower error compared to a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polynomial Degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept of this algorithm relies on **polynomial degrees**. Adjusting the degree changes the equation and the resulting geometric shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degree 0 (Constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the **polynomial degree is 0**, the equation simplifies to a constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_{\\theta}(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x^0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $x^0 = 1$, the equation becomes a constant value $(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1)$.  \n",
    "The input feature does not influence the prediction, resulting in a **horizontal line**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degree 1 (Linear)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the **polynomial degree is 1**, the equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_{\\theta}(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is identical to **Simple Linear Regression**, producing a straight-line relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degree 2 (Quadratic)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the **polynomial degree is 2**, the equation expands to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_{\\theta}(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Including the $x^2$ term allows the model to generate a curve, fitting non-linear data more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Polynomial Equation (Degree $n$)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a polynomial of **degree $n$**, the equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_{\\theta}(x) = \\beta_0 x^0 + \\beta_1 x^1 + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\beta_3 x^3 + \\dots + \\beta_n x^n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overfitting and Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the correct degree is critical for model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Degree 1 (Underfitting)**: A straight line fails to capture curved data patterns.\n",
    "* **Increasing Degrees**: The curve fits the data points more accurately.\n",
    "* **High Degree (Overfitting)**: The curve becomes overly complex, fitting noise instead of the true trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**:  \n",
    "Choose a polynomial degree that **generalizes** well—capturing the trend without modeling noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polynomial Regression with Multiple Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial Regression can also be applied to datasets with **multiple independent features** (e.g., $x_1$ and $x_2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a model with two features and **degree 2**, the equation expands to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_{\\theta}(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_1^2 + \\beta_4 x_2^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expansion enables modeling complex non-linear relationships in multi-dimensional space.\n"
