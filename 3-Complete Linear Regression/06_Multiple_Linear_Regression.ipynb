    "# Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multiple Linear Regression** expands on simple linear regression by incorporating multiple **independent features** to predict an output, rather than just one.\n",
    "* The **House Pricing Dataset** serves as a primary example, using features like the number of rooms, size of the house, and location to determine price.\n",
    "* The regression equation includes one **intercept** ($\\theta_0$) and multiple **coefficients** ($\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_3, \\dots$) corresponding to each input feature.\n",
    "* **Gradient Descent** in this context involves optimizing all coefficients simultaneously to minimize the **cost function** and reach the **global minima**.\n",

    "## Difference Between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression Recap\n",
    "In **Simple Linear Regression**, the model relies on a single **input feature** (or **independent feature**) to predict an output. A classic example is using **weight** to predict **height**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for a single feature is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **$\\theta_0$**: The **Intercept**\n",
    "* **$\\theta_1$**: The **Slope**\n",
    "* **$x$**: The input data from the training set\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the algorithm only needs to update $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ to find the **best fit line**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "**Multiple Linear Regression** applies when a dataset contains more than one **input feature**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: House Pricing Dataset\n",
    "To illustrate this, consider a **House Pricing Dataset** with the following attributes:\n",
    "* **Number of Rooms** ($x_1$)\n",
    "* **Size of the House** ($x_2$)\n",
    "* **Location** ($x_3$)\n",
    "* **Price of the House** (Output Feature)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the first three attributes act as the **Independent Features**, while the price is the **Output Feature**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Multiple Linear Regression Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical representation changes to accommodate the additional features. The hypothesis equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + \\theta_2x_2 + \\theta_3x_3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breakdown of Parameters\n",
    "* **$\\theta_0$ (Intercept)**: There is always exactly one intercept in any regression problem, regardless of the number of features.\n",
    "* **$\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_3$ (Coefficients/Slopes)**: Each input feature has a corresponding coefficient.\n",
    "    * $\\theta_1$ is the coefficient for the **Number of Rooms**\n",
    "    * $\\theta_2$ is the coefficient for the **Size of the House**\n",
    "    * $\\theta_3$ is the coefficient for the **Location**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of **input features** increases, the number of **coefficients** increases accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Descent in Multiple Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying **Gradient Descent** to multiple linear regression, the visualization shifts from a simple 2D or 3D graph to a multi-dimensional concept. While it is impossible to draw a 4D diagram, the underlying principle remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Cost Function** ($J(\\theta)$) typically forms an **inverted mountain** or bowl shape.\n",
    "* The algorithm initializes starting points for all parameters ($\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\dots$).\n",
    "* The objective is to iteratively update all coefficients to converge at the **Global Minima**, thereby minimizing the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process involves continuously changing all $\\theta$ values ($\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_3$) to reduce the cost function.\n"
